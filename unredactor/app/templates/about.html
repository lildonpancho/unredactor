<h1>About Unredactor:</h1>
<p>


<p class="wrapped">Unredactor is an interactive app to edit with words. You can redact and enter text with this new app. The app is made to interact with the text and redact words etc. Not only that, this app is able to predict the words the user can come up with, and is enjoyable. The app is created for users to fill in the blanks, with the app being able to redact and predict words that are reasonable with the context and not unexpected like "Mad Libs." The Unredactor works by using a Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. The Unredactor app is a great way to show others the beauty and mystics of technology working on its own. Users will see the technology really working in the app. </p>
